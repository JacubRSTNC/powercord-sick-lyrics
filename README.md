# Sick Lyrics

This is my first plugin made for powercord so **pog**.

Installation:

1. Run ``git clone https://github.com/JacubRSTNC/powercord-sick-lyrics.git`` in your powercord plugins directory
2. Open up Discord and go to Settings and press Plugins. 
3. Press the 3 dots and press "Load missing plugins".
4. And it's done! :)

Usage: 
```
You're able to do .help for a list of commands but here they are:
.lyrics Song Name [--send]
--send is optional, put it there and everyone will be able to see your message.
There are also 2 aliases, .l Song Name [--send] & .songtext Song Name [--send]
```
